# Code of Conduct

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project and our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible
or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, caste, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and activities: GitHub issues, pull
requests, mailing lists, chat rooms, video calls, in-person events, and any other project
related interactions.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Showing empathy toward other community members
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without
  explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional
  setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable
behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior
that they deem inappropriate, abusive, threatening, or otherwise in violation of this Code
of Conduct.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, pull
requests, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this
Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an
individual is acting in their capacity as a representative of the project. Examples of
representative actions include using an official project email address, posting on an
official project social account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or
offline event. Representatives of the project are expected to follow this Code of Conduct in
all interactions, both online and off.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it.

- Preferred: Email a member of the project leadership team at: [INSERT EMAIL HERE]
- Alternative: Open an issue in this repository titled "Code of Conduct incident" and
  include relevant details and context. If you need the report to be confidential, indicate
  that in the issue and maintainers will handle confidentiality to the extent possible.

When reporting, please include as much of the following information as you can:

- What happened (detailed description)
- When it happened (date/time)
- Where it happened (issue link, PR link, chatroom, in-person event, etc.)
- The names or identifiers of the people involved
- Any evidence (screenshots, links, copies of messages)

## Enforcement Process

1. After a report is received, maintainers will acknowledge receipt within a reasonable
   timeframe and review the report.
2. The maintainers may request additional information from the reporter or from involved
   parties to understand the situation fully.
3. Maintainers will determine whether the report constitutes a violation of this Code of
   Conduct and decide on a response. Possible responses include a private warning, a public
   or private apology, temporary or permanent removal from project spaces, revocation of
   commit or merge rights, or involving relevant authorities when behavior is unlawful.
4. In cases where confidentiality is requested, information will be shared only with those
   who need to know in order to investigate and act on the report.

## Appeals

If you are subject to enforcement action and wish to appeal, please contact the project
leadership using the reporting channels above and clearly state your reasons for the
appeal. Maintainers will review appeals on a case-by-case basis.
